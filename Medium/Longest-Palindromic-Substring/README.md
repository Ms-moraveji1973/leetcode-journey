## ðŸ§  Problem Explanation

- A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards (like `"abba"` or `"racecar"`).
- The goal is to find the **longest contiguous substring** of `s` that is a palindrome.
- We're not looking for just the length â€” we must return the actual substring.
