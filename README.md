# ðŸš€ Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

This repository contains the algorithm problems I have solved on LeetCode.
I write clear comments and explain my solutions as simply as possible.
If you have any feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
I would appreciate hearing from you.

Each problem includes:
- The solution code
- A link to the official problem and its description
- A brief explanation of the problem

---

Each difficulty folder contains:
- A subfolder for each problem
- Each problem folder includes:
  - `solution.py` â€” the solution code with clear comments
  - `README.md` â€” problem description, link, and explanation
